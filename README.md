# Data Cleaning with SQL
•	This project is completed using a YouTube video from "Alex The Analyst" portfolio project series  
•	Firstly, the data format was standardized and the missing property addresses were populated using self join  
•	Then the data was enriched by making additional columns of city and state from owner and property addresses  
•	Data consistency was ensured by using CASE statement  
•	Finally duplicates and redundant columns were removed using CTE
